4-Bit Sequential Arithmetic ALU

FPGA-Based Digital Logic Design on DE1-SoC

A complete Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed and implemented in VHDL, featuring 11 operations including combinational logic, arithmetic, and sequential functions with real-time 7-segment display output.

Overview

This project implements a fully functional 4-bit ALU synthesized on an Intel/Altera DE1-SoC FPGA board. The system processes two 4-bit inputs through user-selectable operations and displays results on a 7-segment display in real-time. The design combines both combinational logic (gates, arithmetic, comparison) and sequential logic (shift registers, bidirectional counter).

- Platform: DE1-SoC (Cyclone V FPGA)
